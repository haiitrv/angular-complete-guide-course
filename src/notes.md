# Angular?

- Angular is a framework that allows to create SPA.
  -> Only index.html which is served.

# Components

- Key feature in Angular.
- The whole app is built by composing from a couple of components.
- App (root) component holds our entire app, will later nest other components.
- Each component has its own template, styling, business logic.
  -> Great benefit: Split up the complex app into reusable parts.

# AppModule

- It is a bundle of functionalities of our app and it basically gives Angular information which features does my app have and use.
